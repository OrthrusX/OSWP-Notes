# OSWP Notes

This repository contains my personal notes for preparing for the Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP) certification.

These notes are **not a full summary or a replacement for the PEN-210 course**. Instead, they are a collection of concise, practical references and commands that I found most useful during my preparation.

They focus on the essential tools and techniques required to pass the exam, including:

- Common Wi-Fi attack scenarios (WEP, WPA-PSK, WPA-Enterprise)
- Usage of tools like aircrack-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, hostapd-mana, and freeradius
- Key command examples and troubleshooting notes
- Tips for the exam environment and reporting

While these notes do not cover every detail from the course, they are designed to be **enough to guide you through the exam successfully**.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or use them as a starting point for your own study.
